## Grab the tables from the page and use the html_table function to extract the tables.
## You need to subset temp to find the data you're interested in (HINT: html_table())

##taking the actual data table we want from the website

##now I'm extracting data by party so I can plot each party's data in a different color later

dem_rows<-grep("Dem.", presidential_data$Party) #finding out which rows are democratic wins

dem_years<-dem_data$Year #creating an object of democratic win years
dem_turnout<-dem_data$Turnout #creating an object of turnout percentege in democratic rows
